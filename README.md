# Deceptive-Transactions-Unveiling-Credit-Card-Fraud
Final Project of Statistical Computation II

XYZ Bank, a leading financial institution, faced significant challenges in detecting credit card fraud. Traditional rule-based systems struggled to keep up with the evolving tactics employed by fraudsters. To enhance their fraud detection capabilities, XYZ Bank implemented a machine learning model tailored to their specific needs. 
To tackle this challenge, we engaged in data processing and developed various models, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost Classifier. Ultimately, we opted for the XGBoost Classifier and conducted hyperparameter tuning on this model, resulting in an accuracy of 99.508% upon public submission.
